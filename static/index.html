				<div class="faq-question-section">
					<h3 class="faq-question">Q: What is Olin.link?</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						A: Olin.link is a URL shortener, much like bit.ly, is.gd, or tinyurl.com. It
						takes a long URL:

						<pre>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLh6RhVyW42e4iyw8OjJp_uu9bLQHZtzrr2XKscvndU/edit</pre
						>

						and turns it into a short one:

						<pre>https://olin.link/VeryImportantDocument</pre>

						As opposed to the long url, the short one is:
						<ul>
							<li>Shorter</li>
							<li>Easier to remember</li>
							<li>Easier to say out loud</li>
							<li>
								Easier to print out and type back in (for example, if you put it on
								a poster)
							</li>
							<li>Cooler</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-question-section">
					<h3 class="faq-question">
						Q: Why should I use Olin.link instead of bit.ly/is.gd/tinyurl.com?
					</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						Because it's better! Those tools all have several limitations that Olin.link
						does not:

						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>It's often hard to get a good shortlink</b>, leaving you with
								something like <code>bit.ly/OlinShopWorkOrder2</code>. Because
								Olin.link is only used by the Olin community, these sorts of naming
								conflicts are much less likely.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you do get a good shortlink (like
								<code>tinyurl.com/menu</code>),
								<b
									>you're polluting the global address pool and preventing anybody
									else from using that shortlink ever again.</b
								>
								With Olin.link, that's much less likely to be an issue because, for
								example, Olin only has one dining hall that only has one menu.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b
									>Olin.link shortlinks can be updated to point to a different
									long URL later on,</b
								>
								even if the original owner has left the community—so
								<code>olin.link/menu</code> can live on forever as the link to the
								current dining hall menu, even if the full URL changes.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b
									><code>tinyurl.com/whatever</code> is boring.
									<code>Olin.link/whatever</code> is cool, unique, and
									interesting.</b
								>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b
									>By using other URL shortening services, you're exposing the
									community to privacy risks</b
								>
								by forcing every request for a resource to go through a 3rd party
								with unknown data protection protocols. Olin.link is less risky
								because it's run by your fellow Oliners—who you hopefully trust a
								bit more than some random strangers on the internet—and because of
								our very strict privacy policy, which is listed below.
							</li>
						</ul>

				<div class="faq-question-section">
					<h3 class="faq-question">
						Q: What can I use Olin.link for? Are there any limitations? Does it cost
						money?
					</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						A: You're welcome to use olin.link for anything you'd like, and it's free!
						As always, please remember the Honor Code and to Be A Good Person.&trade;
						<br />
						<b>Caveat:</b> Olin.link is provided on a best-effort basis. While it's fine
						to share a shortlink publicly, if it goes viral and Olin.link starts getting
						hit hundreds of times per second, it might stop working.

					<h3 class="faq-question">Q: Who's behind Olin.link?</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						Olin.link was built and is maintained by
						<a
							href="mailto:aporad@olin.edu?subject=Olin.link%20Question"
							alt="Email Ari"
							>Ari Porad</a

						TinyURLs.

				<div class="faq-question-section">
					<h3 class="faq-question">
						Q: Is Olin.link open-source? Can I contribute to it?
					</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						Yes! Olin.link's code can be found
						<a href="https://github.com/ariporad/olin.link" alt="Olin.link Github Repo"
							>on GitHub</a

					<h3 class="faq-question">Q: What's Olin.link's Privacy Policy?</h3>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						Privacy is a fundemental human right, and Olin.link tries hard to respect
						your privacy.

						<h4>When you create a shortlink, we collect and store:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The long URL that your shortlink points to</li>
							<li>
								The short URL that you've requested, or a randomly-generated default
							</li>
							<li>Your IP address, for fraud prevention</li>
							<li>
								Your Olin email address, for fraud prevention, so we can reach out
								if there's an issue with your shortlink, and so we can know who's
								allowed to edit a shortlink.
							</li>
							<li>The time</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>When somebody clicks on a shortlink, we collect and store:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The shortlink they requested</li>
							<li>
								Their IP address, in anonymized form. Specifically, if they're
								on-campus or connecting from the Olin network, we store that.
								Otherwise, we store their IP address with the last octet zeroed out
								(for example,
								<code>12.34.56.78</code> is stored in anonymized form as
								<code>12.34.56.0</code>).
							</li>
							<li>The time</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Here's how we use that information:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								We use this information for the obvious purpose of matching
								shortlinks to long URLs
							</li>
							<li>
								We use that information to allow you to change the long URL that
								your shortlink points to
							</li>
							<li>
								We may use that information to combat fraud, improve the service,
								and generally understand how people are using Olin.link
							</li>
							<li>
								We may use your email to contact you if we have concerns about one
								of your shortlinks or if there's another issue
							</li>
							<li>
								We may provide any of this information to the Olin administration,
								StAR, the Honor Board, or another entity if we have a legitimite
								reason to believe that it's in the interests of the community
							</li>
							<li>
								If we receive a valid legal order from a law enforcement authority
								with relevant jurisdiction, we'll be forced to turn over any of the
								data we've collected
							</li>
